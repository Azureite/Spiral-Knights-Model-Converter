**The code I use in my program is exactly the same as Spiral Spy!**


Q: "But Xan, if it's the exact same code, why doesn't your program look like Spiral Spy?"

A: I use the same *libraries (code)* as Spiral Spy. (You can see the list in Credits.md). The guy who made Spiral Spy over at onyxbits simply, as he said, put the pieces together. I did the same thing, just in my own fashion.



Q: "So wait, if it's the same code, why does _______ work for him but not for you?"

A: The way the libraries were designed makes it this way. Spiral Spy works because everything is internal - Nothing leaves Spiral Spy except for what was specifically coded in to leave (i.e. .DAT to .XML). Think of it like agar.io, where a smaller cell is the .DAT and a bigger cell is the program. The .DAT goes into the program and stays there, practically becoming part of it. What I'm trying to do is comparable to making that big cell into a colored mirror - I want the little cell (.dat) to hit the big cell, then bounce off as a different color (Different file format). As we players of agar.io know, this doesn't really work - you're gonna get absorbed - and a hack that does that in the game would be difficult to make. My goal is to create that mirror out of my own, external code. *Alongside all of this, I have to follow the TOS! I can't modify Three Rings's code or else I'm in some deep doo-doo.* **That is why this program is taking so long: I have to practically re-create a few pieces of code in order for this to be allowed.**
