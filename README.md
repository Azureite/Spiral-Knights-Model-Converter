#Spiral Knights Model to OBJ

The current code in the repository **is not** up to date (As compared to my eclipse workspace) **THIS MEANS DO NOT DOWNLOAD SOURCES UNLESS IT IS PACKED IN AN "Actual.Source.Code.zip" FILE IN THE RELEASES TAB!**.

The latest release is stable, however the code in the repository **is not** stable.

#What is Spiral Knights Model to OBJ?
Spiral Knights model to OBJ is a tool for anyone who wants to animate or 3D print models from Spiral Knights!

The tool is very straightforward and easy to use. It opens 3D Models from Spiral Knights and converts them to a format that tools such as Blender or Autodesk 3DS Max can open for usage in animation / 3D printing.


#What can it convert?
 - XML Exported from Spiral Spy (http://spiral.onyxbits.de/download) (Fun fact: Spiral Spy uses the same exact code I use)
 - DAT Directly from the Spiral Knights game files (NO TEXTURES)

#Plans for the future
This is the list of what I plan to improve or add in this project.

*CONFIRMED*
 - [Done!] Project revamp that allows save/open dialog as opposed to the terrible method of text copy/paste 
 - [In progress... (50%)] Project revamp that allows directly importing .DAT (And .PNG texture) files and saving as .OBJ + Textures

*PLAUSIBLE*
 - [Currently inactive] Export Blender .BLEND format for model, texture, and animation.

*CONSIDERED BUT NOT GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED*
 - Compact and user friendly model + animation editor in the program
 - Export VALVE .MDL files for usage in Source Film-Maker

#What do I have done right now?
 - Improved file reading (Slightly faster reading) + Save/Open dialog
 - Full-scale .DAT reading. It can now convert the model. Not the texture, however.

#Special Thanks
 - Three Rings Design: You guys are awesome! Thank you **so much** for making your source code open source. I couldn't have done this without you guys.
 - The Spiral Knights community. Some of you guys have been following my topics and giving feedback (More, "I can't wait for this program!") and letting me know that this project matters.
 - People whose libraries I used.

#Contact me
Please only contact me if you're interested in helping out or have a question regarding how ThreeRings code works (Which I probably won't be able to answer too well. I can't explain things very well.)
