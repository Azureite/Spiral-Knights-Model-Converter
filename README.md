#Spiral Knights Model to OBJ

The current code in the repository **is not** up to date. **THIS MEANS DO NOT DOWNLOAD SOURCES UNLESS IT IS PACKED IN AN "Actual.Source.Code.zip" FILE IN THE RELEASES TAB!**.

The latest release is stable, however the code in the repository **is not** stable.

Current work status: **Working on project!**

#What is Spiral Knights Model to OBJ?
Spiral Knights model to OBJ is a tool for anyone who wants to animate or 3D print models from Spiral Knights!

The tool is very straightforward and easy to use. It opens 3D Models from Spiral Knights and converts them to a format that tools such as Blender or Autodesk 3DS Max can open for usage in animation / 3D printing.


#What can it convert?
 - XML Exported from Spiral Spy (http://spiral.onyxbits.de/download) (Fun fact: Spiral Spy uses the same exact code I use)
 - DAT Directly from the Spiral Knights game files (NO TEXTURES)

#When will you release it?
 - I'm hoping I can get it released some time withing the week. I have texture UV coordinates down, however they are mapped to the inccorrect vertices.

#Special Thanks
 - Three Rings Design: You guys are awesome! Thank you **so much** for making your source code open source. I couldn't have done this without you guys.
 - The Spiral Knights community. Some of you guys have been following my topics and giving feedback (More, "I can't wait for this program!") and letting me know that this project matters.
 - People whose libraries I used.

#Footnotes
â€  - As for the custom model export, you may be curious as to why I'm not just making a tool for Blender that allows direct .DAT imports. Keep in mind that .DAT files are DESIGNED to be read by Java, and that I cannot use Python to accurately read them.
