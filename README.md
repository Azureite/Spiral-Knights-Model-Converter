# Spiral Knights DAT to OBJ
The new and improved version of "Spiral Spy XML to OBJ"!



#// WORK SO FAR
 - Improved file reading (Slightly faster reading) + Save/Open dialog (ONLY WORKS WITH XML. TUTORIAL IN RELEASES!)
 - Preparations for .DAT reading (Work has been sorta started? I've been looking into how the files work.)

#// ISSUES THAT HINDER WORK
 - Schoolwork
 - .DAT Model format understanding
 - Work ethic

#// PLANS
This is the list of what I plan to improve or add in this project.

*CONFIRMED*
 - Project revamp that allows save/open dialog as opposed to the terrible method of text copy/paste
 - Project revamp that allows directly importing .DAT (And .PNG texture) files and saving as .OBJ + Textures

*PLAUSIBLE*
 - Custom format export + Python import script to Blender that not only stores model and texture, but ANIMATION. (File format: *.XMDL)

*CONSIDERED BUT NOT GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED*
 - Compact and user friendly model + animation editor in the program
 - Export VALVE .MDL files for usage in Source Film-Maker

#// TO DO LIST, IDEAS, AND NOTE THINGIES
 - Should I try to copy in Three Rings's code into my project? This would have to be quite hacky, but it may be what I have to do.
 - So I've realized that the .DAT files are practically "embedded" into the code - This is to say that the code reads it and handles it in itself. So yes, I need to use their own code to convert this. Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii....
