# Spiral Knights DAT to OBJ
The new and improved version of "Spiral Spy XML to OBJ"!

#// PLANS
This is the list of what I plan to improve or add in this project.
CONFIRMED
 - Project revamp that allows save/open dialog as opposed to the terrible method of text copy/paste
 - Project revamp that allows directly importing .DAT files and saving as .OBJ + Textures

PLAUSIBLE
 - Custom format export + Python import script to Blender that not only stores model and texture, but ANIMATION. (File format: *.XMDL)

PPLANNED BUT NOT GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED
 - Compact and user friendly model + animation editor in the program
 - Export VALVE .MDL files for usage in Source Film-Maker


#// WORK SO FAR
 - Improved file reading (Slightly faster reading) + Save/Open dialog
 - Preparations for .DAT reading (Work has been sorta started? I've been looking into how the files work. They MIGHT be .FBX files with a byte offset...)
