Current work status: **Working on project!**

#What is Spiral Knights Model to OBJ?
Spiral Knights model to OBJ is a tool for anyone who wants to animate or 3D print models from Spiral Knights!

The tool is very straightforward and easy to use. It opens 3D Models from Spiral Knights and converts them to a format that tools such as Blender or Autodesk 3DS Max can open for usage in animation / 3D printing.


#What can it convert?
 - XML Exported from Spiral Spy (http://spiral.onyxbits.de/download) (Fun fact: Spiral Spy uses the same exact code I use)
 - DAT Directly from the Spiral Knights game files

#When will you release it?
 - SKDatOBJ / SK Model to OBJ has been released, however I have pulled it back due to some issues.

#Special Thanks
