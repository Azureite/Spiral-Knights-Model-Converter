/**
 * Used to define rule sets that can be nested within other rule sets. For
 * example, say you have a "scene" object definition like so:
 *
 * <p> (Note that in the examples square brackets are used instead of
 * angle brackets to simplify my life when composing the documentation.)
 *
 * <pre>
 * [scene name="Foo" version=5]
 * [/scene]
 * </pre>
 *
 * This scene is extended with some auxiliary data defined by libraries
 * which can parse and generate XML for their auxiliary objects:
 *
 * <pre>
 * [scene sceneId=1 name="Foo" version=5]
 *   [spot]
 *     [portal portalId=1 x=1 y=1 targetSceneId=2/]
 *     [portal portalId=2 x=15 y=3 targetSceneId=3/]
 *     [portal portalId=3 x=9 y=6 targetSceneId=4/]
 *   [/spot]
 *   [miso]
 *     [object tileId=878172 x=4 y=13 action="cluck"/]
 *     [object tileId=123843 x=18 y=23 action="bark"/]
 *   [/miso]
 * [/scene]
 * </pre>
 *
 * The spot and miso services can define nestable rule sets which will be
 * handed to the scene services who will instruct them to add their rule
 * instances with a prefix of <code>scene.spot</code> and
 * <code>scene.miso</code> respectively. They then happily parse their
 * auxiliary objects without knowing that they have been nested inside
 * some larger structure.
 *
 * <p> The nestable ruleset should then leave a single object on the
 * digester stack that the enclosing entity can grab.
 *
 * <p> This isn't proper use of XML, but it solves the problem at hand in
 * an easily extensible manner.
