/**
 * An object tile extends the base tile to provide support for objects whose image spans more than
 * one unit tile.
 *
 * <p> An object tile is generally positioned based on its origin rather than the upper left of
 * its image. Generally this origin is in the bottom center of the object image, but can be
 * configured to be anywhere that the natural center point of "contact" is for the object. Note
 * that this does not automatically adjust the semantics of {@link Tile#paint}, it is just
 * expected that the caller will account for the object tile's origin when painting, if
 * appropriate.
 *
 * <p> An object tile has dimensions (in tile units) that represent its footprint or "shadow".
